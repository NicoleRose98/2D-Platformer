About the game.
--
This is a 2-dimentional vertical platformer made using the SumoDigital PlayBuffer.
The aim of the game is to climb up the platforms inorder to collect three different keys and bring them to the door.



Features of the game.
--
Player Controls: Using the left and right arrow keys to move the player left and right. Use the space bar to jump. Also, when falling, hold shift to use an umberela for slower falling.

Moving platforms: As seen in the gif above, the level consists of alternating static and moving platyforms. The player attaches to the moving platform and move with it but jump off as normal when needed.

NPC with dialogue: There is also a none player character which stands by a door at the bottom right corner of the map. I wanted to implement this feature to help provide a story for the player and to set them up with their objective. When the player is near the the npc they can use TAB to cycle through dialogue. This feature allows for a check to be completed to see how many of the keys have been collected. Only when all three keys are collected and they player has spoken to the npc, will the End game screen be shown.
